## Research description
My research focuses on __3-dimensional manifolds__; these are spaces which locally look like the standard three-dimensional Euclidean space (or half-space) but globally can be much more complicated. A common strategy is to try to equip them with various additional structures, such as metrics, decompositions into polyhedra (in particular triangulations), decompositions into lower-dimensional subsets (foliations), or group actions, which allow one to study the manifold from various different perspectives.

Aspects of 3-dimensional topology which are central in my work are __fibrations over the circle__ with __pseudo-Anosov monodromy__ and, more generally, __pseudo-Anosov flows__. I study them combinatorially using __veering triangulations__, certain ideal triangulations of the complement of finitely many closed orbits of the flow.

The main advantage of using veering triangulations to study pseudo-Anosov flows is that they are combinatorial objects with a very rigid structure. This often simplifies proofs of theorems relating pseudo-Anosov flows to other structures in 3-dimensional topology. See for instance the [relation between the Teichm√ºller polynomials and certain twisted Alexander polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12162v3).

Moreover, there are many computer programs available to study 3-manifolds using their triangulations ([SnapPy](https://snappy.math.uic.edu/), [Regina](https://regina-normal.github.io/) etc.) that were used to build a database of veering triangulations and write code to study these triangulations. In other words, passing from pseudo-Anosov flows to veering triangulations allows one to study flows experimentally.
