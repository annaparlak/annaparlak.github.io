I am a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. 

I study __three-dimensional manifolds__ using combinatorial methods.

You can get in contact with me at <img src="files/MPI_email2.jpg" width="150" alt="email">  

&nbsp;


Before coming to MPI MiS, I was a Krener Assistant Professor at the __University of California, Davis__ (2022 - 2025), Postdoctoral Research Associate at the __University of Oxford__ (2021 - 2022), a PhD student at the __University of Warwick__ (2017 - 2021), and a MSc (2015 - 2017) and a BSc (2012 - 2015) student at the __University of Gdańsk__. 

Besides mathematics, I also have a BSc in biotechnology.
