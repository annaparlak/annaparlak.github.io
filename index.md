I am leading the [Low-Dimensional Topology](https://www.mis.mpg.de/low-dimensional-topology) group at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. 

From __January till May 2026__ I will be a Research Member at the [_Topological and Geometric Structures in Low Dimensions_](https://www.slmath.org/programs/368) program organized by the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute in Berkeley, California.

Before coming to MPI MiS, I was a Krener Assistant Professor at the __University of California, Davis__ (2022 - 2025), Postdoctoral Research Associate at the __University of Oxford__ (2021 - 2022), a PhD student at the __University of Warwick__ (2017 - 2021), and a MSc (2015 - 2017) and BSc (2012 - 2015) student at the __University of Gdańsk__. 

Besides mathematics, I also have a BSc in biotechnology.

### Open positions at MPI MiS

If you are interested in working with me, consider applying for a __PhD student__ or a __postdoctoral__ position at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences. You have the option to name me as your preferred mentor in the application.

[PhD Call 2026](https://www.mis.mpg.de/career/imprs/apply) (deadline: November 1st, 2025)

[Postdoc Call 2026](https://www.mis.mpg.de/career/postdoc) (deadline: December 1st, 2025)

_This is an institute-wide call for a postdoctoral researcher._ 

[Low-Dimensional Topology Call](https://www.mis.mpg.de/career/postdoctoral-research-scientist-low-dimensional-topology-dynamics) (deadline: December 1st, 2025)

_This is a dedicated call for a postdoctoral researcher to join my research group, [Low-dimensional topology](https://www.mis.mpg.de/low-dimensional-topology)._ 

If you apply for the LDT postdoc, your application will also be considered for the institute’s general postdoc call. Therefore you’re welcome to list other potential mentors in your application besides me (up to 3 in total). -->
