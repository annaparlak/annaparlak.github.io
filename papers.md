1. _The taut polynomial and the Alexander polynomial_ <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()"> (Click to pop-up the abstract)
     <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">Landry, Minsky and Taylor defined the taut polynomial of a veering
triangulation. Its specialisations generalise the Teichm¨uller polynomial of a fibred
face of the Thurston norm ball. We prove that the taut polynomial of a veering
triangulation is equal to a certain twisted Alexander polynomial of the underlying
manifold. Then we give formulas relating the taut polynomial and the untwisted
Alexander polynomial. There are two formulas; one holds when the maximal free
abelian cover of a veering triangulation is edge-orientable, another holds when it is
not edge-orientable.
Furthermore, we consider 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn filling a veering triangulation. In this case we give a formula that relates the specialisation of the taut
polynomial under the Dehn filling and the Alexander polynomial of the Dehn-filled
manifold. This extends a theorem of McMullen connecting the Teichm¨uller polynomial and the Alexander polynomial to the nonfibred setting, and improves it in the
fibred case. We also prove a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of
an orientable fibred class in the cone over a fibred face of the Thurston norm ball.</span>
